TODO

mem space reduction
	Crypto needs to know word count before Crypto ini build
	- lines need to parced and words counted
	- using the word counts plugboard counts can be initiated (see below)
	
security upgrade
	- plugboard count can be reduced to ~ somewhat > word count, plugboardcount(permutaitons) security will increase
	as they will vary in size based on msg size

notes: currently there is not way of reducing the rotor size


TODO (?? Maybe)
Rotor/Pb size (mem space) can be significantly reduced (< 5% of current, O(n) vs O(n^2)) by only storing values used
during encryption/decryption, unfortunately this will be difficult to follow by a layman, this will be implemented
(??? Maybe) in a latter version with an extensive comment section explaining how the software works. Current design
closely follows physical crypto machines in both form and function. Current memory usage is incredibly inefficient!!!!
notes: only pb can be reduced, rotor size must maintain entire set of values
